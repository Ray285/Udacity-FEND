Module 5 - Optimizations
------------------------
Responsive Tables Hidden Columns:
    -Hides columns based on their importance as the viewport size gets smaller
    -Need to determine the most important content
    -Uses "display: none" property
    -Draw back is that content is hidden from the user, if possible use abbreviated data instead

Responsive Tables - No More Tables:
    -Below a certain viewport width table data is collapsed
    -All data is visible regardless of viewport size
    -example: http://codepen.io/JohnMav/pen/BoGJNy

Responsive Tables - Contained Scrolling:
    -Wrap table in a div, set "width: 100%;", "overflow-x: auto;"
    -This will cause the table to scroll within the viewport
    -example: http://codepen.io/JohnMav/pen/Mazrwm

Fonts:
    -Ideal length of a line for the Web is 65 characters per line (cpl)
    -We need to consider line length as we choose breakpoints for our sites
    -Base font sizes of 16px and 1.2em line height help to provide consistently readable content

Minor Breakpoints:
    -In addition to major breakpoints where layout changes, minor breakpoints may be used
    to make small changes such as margin, padding, font-size, etc;
