You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

    * So far I have learned some HTML5 tags that I was not familiar with such as <em>, <sup>, and <sub>, among many others. I have also learned how to view pages
    as nothing more than trees, this is helpful in reasoning out how I should translate designs to mockups because I now have a process to follow.

    * Learning new HTML tags has been pretty straight forward.

    * So far, I would say the most difficult part has been identifying which HTML tags are best to use in a particular scenario, the figure tag was one that I
    wasn't previously aware of and most likely would not have tried.

    * So far, I am focusing on utilizing the tools pointed out in the first project such as the Mozilla Developer Network and Stack Overflow whenever I am not completely
    sure how I should approach a particular task.
